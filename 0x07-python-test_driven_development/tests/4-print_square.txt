Prints a square with the character #
=======================================
it is a simple library since it has only one function
``print_square(size)`` where size is the length of the square

size has to be an integer

    >>> print_square = __import__("4-print_square").print_square
    >>> print_square(4) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    ####

    >>> print_square(0)

    for size less than zero
    >>> print_square(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: size must be >= 0

    for size of type float and less than 0
    >>> print_square(0.99)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: size must be an integer

    for size thats not an integer
    >>> print_square("square")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: size must be an integer

    when no size passed
    >>> print_square()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
